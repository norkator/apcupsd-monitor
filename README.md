UPS specific notes
============
Always be careful when opening UPS software interfaces to public internet. These interfaces seem to
be interesting target
for security researchers and bad people. Learn to create VPN tunnel from your device to your network
instead and route
traffic trough that. Or use only in local network via WLAN.


APCUPSD
-----

* SSH supported with custom command options.
    * APC NMC (Network Management Card AOS)
    * Synology UPSC with `upsc ups` command.
* NIS protocol supported which is best option for closed|internal network use.

Eaton
-----

* Node ID is same as serial number.
* This app is developed towards IPM version -> `1.69.253` or higher.
* IPM with **https** (default) installation way, which means web UI opens from port **4680**.
    * This app requires valid https certificate with https mode enabled so try have one with your
      IPM server.
        * This is forced by Google in a way that app will get deleted from Google Play if it
          contains vulnerable workarounds.
        * Possible solution for certificates https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/windows-other.html
    * It might be possible to have ip address with valid certificate but I personally don't know.
        *
      See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2043617/is-it-possible-to-have-ssl-certificate-for-ip-address-not-domain-name.
* IPM with cleartext **http** >> **NOT RECOMMENDED**
    * Use this only if you have no other way.
    * Change IPM configuration to allow http, this means port **4679**.
      ![eaton_unsecure](graphics/eaton_unsecure.png)
    * Switch app https settings toggle to false.
    * Cleartext required special code from app side, which Google may drop support any time.
